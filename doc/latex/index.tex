\subsection*{What is it ?}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It\textquotesingle{}s an {\bfseries easy-\/to-\/use} functional programming library for P\+HP
\item It aim to be P\+HP\textquotesingle{}s Ramda, but with less functions since it\textquotesingle{}s just a side project.
\item It\textquotesingle{}s a bunch of static functions in a class {\ttfamily F} that are very handy for maniuplating objects / arrays
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Why ?}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Because P\+HP lacks of simple and easy-\/to-\/use utilities for functional programming !
\item To prove that we can still have fun with P\+HP (despite the fact that it\textquotesingle{}s P\+HP) !!!
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{Installation and Usage}

Install the library using composer \+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
composer require boehm\_s/fun
\end{DoxyCode}


And then, import it in your files \+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
use \hyperlink{classboehm__s_1_1F}{boehm\_s\(\backslash\)F};
\end{DoxyCode}


Everything\textquotesingle{}s up and running, you can play with it !


\begin{DoxyCode}
$greetings = [
    [\textcolor{stringliteral}{'hello'}, \textcolor{stringliteral}{'world'}, \textcolor{charliteral}{'!'}],
    [\textcolor{stringliteral}{'how'}, \textcolor{stringliteral}{'are'}, \textcolor{stringliteral}{'you'}, \textcolor{charliteral}{'?'}]
];

$fn = F::compose(\textcolor{stringliteral}{'strtoupper'}, F::partial(\textcolor{stringliteral}{'implode'}, [\textcolor{charliteral}{' '}]));
$values = F::map($fn, $greetings);

echo $values[0]; \textcolor{comment}{// "HELLO WORLD !"}
\end{DoxyCode}


\section*{Philosophy}

Using {\itshape fun-\/php} should be as painless as possible \+: no weird syntax, no O\+OP syntax, just functions (everywhere) !

As with Ramda, all the functions are automatically curried, and data comes last so you can easely compose them. Also, placeholders are implemented ! It means that the followings are equivalent \+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{comment}{// F::\_ is the placeholder}

F::map(\textcolor{stringliteral}{'strtoupper'}, [\textcolor{stringliteral}{'hello'}, \textcolor{stringliteral}{'world'}, \textcolor{charliteral}{'!'}]);
F::map(\textcolor{stringliteral}{'strtoupper'})([\textcolor{stringliteral}{'hello'}, \textcolor{stringliteral}{'world'}, \textcolor{charliteral}{'!'}]);
F::map(F::\_, [\textcolor{stringliteral}{'hello'}, \textcolor{stringliteral}{'world'}, \textcolor{charliteral}{'!'}])(\textcolor{stringliteral}{'strtoupper'});
\end{DoxyCode}

\section*{Running the test suite}

To run the test suite, you\textquotesingle{}ll need {\ttfamily composer} to be installed.

Then, install the dependencies (phpunit) \+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
composer install
\end{DoxyCode}


And run the test \+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
composer test
\end{DoxyCode}
