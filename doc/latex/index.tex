functional programming utilities for P\+HP !

\subsection*{What is it ?}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It\textquotesingle{}s an {\bfseries easy-\/to-\/use} functional programming library for P\+HP
\item It aim to be P\+HP\textquotesingle{}s Ramda, but with less functions since it\textquotesingle{}s just a side project.
\item It\textquotesingle{}s a bunch of static functions in a class {\ttfamily F} that are very handy for maniuplating objects / arrays
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Why ?}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Because P\+HP lacks of simple and easy-\/to-\/use utilities for functional programming !
\item To prove that we can still have fun with P\+HP (despite the fact that it\textquotesingle{}s P\+HP) !!!
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{Installation and Usage}

Install the library using composer \+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
composer require boehm\_s/fun
\end{DoxyCode}


And then, import it in your files \+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
use boehm\_s\(\backslash\)F;
\end{DoxyCode}


Everything\textquotesingle{}s up and running, you can play with it !


\begin{DoxyCode}
$greetings = [
    ['hello', 'world', '!'],
    ['how', 'are', 'you', '?']
];

$fn = F::compose('strtoupper', F::partial('implode', [' ']));
$values = F::map($fn, $greetings);

echo $values[0]; // "HELLO WORLD !"
\end{DoxyCode}


\section*{Philosophy}

Using {\itshape fun-\/php} should be as painless as possible \+: no weird syntax, no O\+OP syntax, just functions (everywhere) !

As with Ramda, all the functions are automatically curried, and data comes last so you can easely compose them. Also, placeholders are implemented ! It means that the followings are equivalent \+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
// F::\_ is the placeholder

F::map('strtoupper', ['hello', 'world', '!']);
F::map('strtoupper')(['hello', 'world', '!']);
F::map(F::\_, ['hello', 'world', '!'])('strtoupper');
\end{DoxyCode}
